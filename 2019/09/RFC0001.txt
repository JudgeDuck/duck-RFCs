==========

1. There is at most one library source file, named as "lib.cpp".
2. Library can not have its own header files. If some library needs to include some header file, put it into the library.
3. Library source file is compiled with the same compiler and same options as the contestant's source file's.
4. Upon compilation, the library file is checked before compiling the contestant's file. If there is a library file, compile it. Otherwise library compilation is skipped.
5. Upon linkage, if there is a library object file, link it. Otherwise library linkage is skipped.
6. There is no other difference between interactive problems and traditional problems.
