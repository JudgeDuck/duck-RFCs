1. There is at most one library source file, named as "lib.cpp".
2. The library can have its own header files. These files should be placed in a directory named as "lib_include".
3. The library can provide public header files to contestants. These files should be placed in a directory named as "include".
4. The library source file is compiled with the same options as the contestant's C++ source files'.
5. Upon compilation, the library source file is checked before compiling the contestant's file. If there is a library source file, compile it. Otherwise library compilation is skipped.
6. Upon linkage, if there is a library object file, link it. Otherwise library linkage is skipped.
7. There is no other difference between interactive problems and traditional problems.
